# MathML Core

Mathematical Markup Language (MathML) is a dialect of XML for describing mathematical notation and capturing both its structure and content.

MathML Core is a new version of the standard, with a reduced set of elements and attributes.

This library provides access to MathML Core nodes and attributes, compatible with `elm/html`.
